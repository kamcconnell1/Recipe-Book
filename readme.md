# RESTful API

## Introduction

Your task is to build a RESTful Express API! You should include INDEX and CREATE for a single resource. 

### Requirements

Use your lesson notes along with the classwork from today as a reference.

* You should have one model (of your choice)
* You should be able to access the INDEX and CREATE routes
* Data must be persisted to a Mongo database

### Bonus

* Have a go at adding the other RESTful routes: SHOW, UPDATE and DELETE.
